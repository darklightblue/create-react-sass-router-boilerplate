Pretty much everything in [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I added [classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames) as it is quite useful when working with css modules.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` / `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Follow Create react app documentation.
